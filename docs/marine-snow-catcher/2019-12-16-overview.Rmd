# description: Map and list of past deployments
---

This map shows all MSC deployments that we know of. To get deployment details, click on a cluster and marker, and information about the programme, cruise and contact person will pop up. Each contact person has a different colour, so you know whether more than one contact person is in a cluster.

If you have deployed MSCs yourself but they are not on this map yet, please add details here (<a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fg1nZG83Tn93oL3YvKCVMqvsX5Xo9Vz4532BX9BK4wQ/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">link</a>)
or contact Sari Giering. (Your data will show up next time I render this page.)
